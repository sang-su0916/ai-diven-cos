## Learning Notes

This video by Sean Chen shares 8 essential principles for building effective AI agent systems, based on feedback from AI founders, investors, and customers.

### 1. Smart Defaults over Infinite Customization

Instead of giving users unlimited customization options, provide **smart defaults** based on domain expertise. Users are not prompt engineers—wrong inputs can degrade performance.

**Example:** In a legal AI like Harvey, an immigration law expert with 10 years of experience sets the default prompt for green card applications, preventing beginners from making errors.

### 2. Meet Users Where They Are

Don't force users to change their existing workflows. Integrate AI into tools they already use (Notion, Google Sheets, etc.).

**Example:** If a startup uses Google Sheets, design your AI agent to work within Sheets rather than forcing them to adopt a new dashboard.

### 3. Vertical-First Strategy

Focus on a specific industry first to build high-quality examples that reduce the model's "foolish behavior." LLMs have a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture—specialize as one expert.

**Example:** Provide 20-30 domain-specific examples (e.g., JSON file processing) to your chatbot agent. Expand horizontally after proving success.

### 4. Examples Must Be Carefully Balanced

Too few examples make the model think narrowly; too many or wrong examples cause overfitting. Structure examples naturally and in balance.

### 5. Write Workflows as Explicit Natural-Language Specs

Minimize hallucination and increase predictability with step-by-step natural language instructions. Explanations work better than just throwing JSON.

**Example:** "Step 1: Check ABCD. In this case, use Stripe API. If authorized user, fetch data from Supabase."

### 6. Add Human-in-the-Loop Correction Loops

Add approval/rejection cycles for micro-training improvements. Especially useful in customer support (CX).

**Example:** Sierra AI and DoorDash trigger human intervention when dealing with angry customers. Good/bad examples improve future performance.

### 7. Give Your Agent a Single Memory Layer

In multi-agent systems, maintain shared context (chat history, highlights, calendar, etc.) in a single layer for consistency.

**Example:** In Notion AI, a paragraph polishing agent and a summary agent share memory access. Email agents reference previous calendar events.

### 8. Add Continuous Evals to Measure and Enforce Reliability

Agents regress easily, so maintain stability with automatic evaluations for workflow scenarios and edge cases.

**Example:** Before sending an email, verify subject, content, signature, and previous context. When Claude models update, verify performance with evals.

## Key Takeaways

- AI agents should be **example-rich**, **self-improving** through human feedback, **simple for customers**, and **verbose** with natural language prompts
- **Evals** and **Memory** are the most important moats for AI products
- LLMs have superpowers; agent failures are prompt failures
- Focus vertically first, then expand after proving market fit

## Simple Explanation

Think of an AI agent like a robot friend helping you run a pizza shop:

1. **Smart Defaults** = Robot already knows a delicious pizza recipe
2. **Meet Users** = Robot works with your existing toy box (tools)
3. **Vertical First** = Master cheese pizza before trying all types
4. **Balanced Examples** = Right amount of recipe examples
5. **Natural Language** = Tell robot step-by-step like talking to a friend
6. **Human Loop** = You correct weird pizzas
7. **Single Memory** = Robot keeps one notebook for everything
8. **Continuous Evals** = Daily taste tests to stay perfect

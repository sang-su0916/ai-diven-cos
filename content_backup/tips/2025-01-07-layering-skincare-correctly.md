# The Correct Order to Layer Skincare

Product order matters more than you think. Apply things in the wrong sequence and you're either wasting product or blocking absorption. Here's how to get it right.

## The Golden Rule

**Thinnest to thickest consistency.**

Water-based products go first, oil-based products go last. Simple as that.

## Morning Routine Order

### 1. Cleanser
Gentle, non-stripping formula. Some skip this in the morning—that's fine too.

### 2. Toner
If you use one. Helps balance pH and adds first layer of hydration.

### 3. Essence
More watery than serum, less than toner. Optional but lovely.

### 4. Serum (Water-Based)
Vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid—your active treatments go here.

### 5. Eye Cream
Before moisturizer so it can absorb properly.

### 6. Moisturizer
Seals in previous steps and provides main hydration.

### 7. Facial Oil (Optional)
If you use one, it goes after moisturizer.

### 8. Sunscreen (ALWAYS)
Always last. Always. This is non-negotiable.

## Evening Routine Order

### 1. Oil Cleanser / Makeup Remover
First cleanse removes sunscreen, makeup, and sebum.

### 2. Water-Based Cleanser
Second cleanse actually cleans your skin.

### 3. Toner
Same as morning—prep and hydration.

### 4. Exfoliant (2-3x per week max)
AHA, BHA, or enzyme treatments. If using, apply here.

### 5. Essence

### 6. Treatment Serum
Retinol, peptides, or targeted treatments. Wait 20-30 minutes after acids.

### 7. Eye Cream

### 8. Night Cream / Moisturizer
Typically richer than daytime formula.

### 9. Facial Oil / Sleeping Mask
Final occlusive layer to lock everything in.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use vitamin C and niacinamide together?**
A: Yes! Despite old myths, they work fine together in modern formulations.

**Q: Where do face masks go?**
A: Sheet masks after serum. Clay masks replace toner through serum steps.

**Q: Can I mix products together to save time?**
A: Generally avoid this—you'll dilute concentrations and potentially destabilize formulas.

**Q: How long should I wait between steps?**
A: Usually 30-60 seconds is enough. Exception: wait 20+ minutes after retinol before applying anything else.

**Q: Do I need all these steps?**
A: No! A basic routine is cleanser → moisturizer → SPF. Build from there.

## Common Mistakes

1. **SPF under moisturizer** — SPF must be last to work properly
2. **Oils before water-based products** — Oil creates barrier, blocking absorption
3. **Too many actives at once** — Pick 1-2 per routine, not 5
4. **Skipping moisturizer with oily skin** — Dehydrated skin produces more oil

## The Minimalist Routine

Don't have time for 10 steps? Here's what actually matters:

**Morning:** Cleanser → Moisturizer → SPF
**Evening:** Cleanser → Treatment → Moisturizer

Everything else is enhancement.

## Conclusion

Product order isn't complicated once you understand the logic: thin to thick, water to oil. When in doubt, follow that rule and you'll be fine.

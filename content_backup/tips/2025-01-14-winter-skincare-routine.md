# Adapting Your Skincare for Winter

Winter doesn't just mean cozy sweaters—it means your skin faces an entirely different environment. Low humidity, harsh winds, and indoor heating all conspire against your moisture barrier.

> "In Korean beauty philosophy, we don't just care for skin—we care for ourselves. As we transition into winter, let's explore how to adapt not just our products, but our entire approach to self-care." — Min-ji Kang

## Why Winter Changes Everything

### Environmental Challenges

| Factor | Summer | Winter | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Humidity | 60-80% | 20-35% | ↓ Moisture retention |
| Temperature | Warm | Cold | ↓ Blood circulation |
| Indoor heating | Minimal | Constant | ↓ Skin hydration |
| UV exposure | High | Low | ↑ Retinol tolerance |

## The Winter Routine Transition

### Step 1: Swap Your Cleanser

**Summer:** Gel or foam cleansers
**Winter:** Cream or oil-based cleansers

Foaming cleansers strip natural oils your skin desperately needs in winter.

### Step 2: Double Down on Hydration

**Add:** Hydrating toner (applied while skin is damp)
**Technique:** 3-5 layers of lightweight hydration > 1 thick layer

The Korean "7-skin method" shines in winter—multiple thin layers penetrate better than one heavy application.

### Step 3: Upgrade Your Moisturizer

**Summer:** Light gel-cream
**Winter:** Rich cream or balm

Look for ingredients like:
- Ceramides
- Squalane
- Shea butter
- Cholesterol

### Step 4: Seal Everything In

**Add:** Facial oil as the last step

This creates an occlusive barrier that prevents trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL).

### Step 5: Don't Abandon SPF

Yes, even in winter. UV rays penetrate clouds and reflect off snow. SPF 30 minimum, every day.

## Weekly Adjustments

### Reduce

- Exfoliation frequency (2x/week → 1x/week)
- Clay masks (can be too drying)
- High-concentration vitamin C (can irritate compromised barriers)

### Increase

- Hydrating masks (2x/week)
- Sheet mask sessions
- Humidifier use (aim for 45-55% indoor humidity)

## Product Swaps Cheat Sheet

| Summer Product | Winter Swap |
|----------------|-------------|
| Gel cleanser | Cream cleanser |
| Water-based toner | Essence toner |
| Light lotion | Rich cream |
| Gel sunscreen | Moisturizing sunscreen |
| Vitamin C serum | Niacinamide + HA serum |

## The Winter Morning Routine

1. Gentle cream cleanser (or just splash water)
2. Hydrating toner (3 layers)
3. Serum (niacinamide or peptides)
4. Eye cream
5. Rich moisturizer
6. Facial oil (3-4 drops, press in)
7. Moisturizing SPF

## The Winter Evening Routine

1. Oil cleanser (remove SPF)
2. Cream cleanser
3. Hydrating toner (3-5 layers)
4. Treatment serum (retinol 1-2x/week)
5. Eye cream
6. Night cream or sleeping mask
7. Facial oil seal

## Common Winter Mistakes

❌ Using hot water (damages barrier)
❌ Skipping moisturizer because skin feels "fine"
❌ Over-exfoliating to combat dullness
❌ Forgetting to hydrate lips and hands

## Signs Your Routine Needs Adjustment

- Tightness after cleansing
- Flaking or peeling (not from retinol)
- Increased sensitivity
- Dull, lackluster appearance
- Makeup not sitting well

## Conclusion

Winter skincare is about protection and nourishment. Listen to your skin—it will tell you what it needs. The key is sealing in hydration and reducing anything that compromises your barrier.
